[**Soulbloom: towards physicalisation of personal data for well-being and communication**](https://searle.hu/assets/Soulbloom.pdf) - *2023*\
Soulbloom is a speculative tangible interface that promotes self-awareness and mental health by mirroring one’s physical and mental state through symbolic interactions. The project aims to imagine a future where AI and robotics can be perceived as empathetic extensions of oneself, furthering our understanding of human-technology relationships and how they are formed.

[**“Can you tell I’m being sarcastic?” Designing for emotional prosody in AAC devices**](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1M2XZepdWIJRz9iM7gxdkttrHa92YvMOTCeMWu9qYSJw/mobilebasic) - *2023*\
As part of my Master's studies, I participated in a group project developing assistive technologies for people with motor neurone disease (MND). Through co-design with Brian, a person with MND, we designed a tool to enable emotionality in computer-assisted communication devices frequently used by people with speech issues. This blog post describes the project and is expected to be published on the department website.
