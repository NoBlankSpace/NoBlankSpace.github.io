The reason I started posting on this website is because some of the best ideas and thoughts I've found on the web were not found on big platforms, but rather people's personal websites. Maggie Appleton's digital garden, Linus "The Sephist" Lee's work on tools for thought, Frederick van Amstel's work on the 'user problem' are some of the most impactful writings in my work and career. 

I used to travel the web regularly to find hidden gems - I imagine myself as a backpacker navigating from old brochures instead of through digital maps and websites that are there to draw me in. Over the past few months this habit had faded, until last week when I found a new personal blog that triggered the 'netpacker' in me. 

Hence this speculative post: **What if there was a plugin for personal websites that indexed the content and linked it to others in a database?** We could find people working on similar things. Like a creative database - or a school directory.

It would be exclusive to individual's sites and no companies or content houses would be allowed. People could be vetted by the group to ensure its integrity. Individuals register their website, install the plugin, their website is then scraped and analysed and indexed, and little chips could appear throughout the site for recommending other members' and their work based on the content. 

I believe we should encourage and embrace personal spaces for our writings. If you're thinking about writing posts on your own website, I offer a few mantras to inspire you why having people come to you instead of you going to them is valuable.

If you write for your own site there's no expectation for a certain audience to read it. This way you can focus on writing it for 'people like you'.

Content is so intertwined with 'business problems' that its difficult to find good writings out there that aren't inherently selling some solution. However, the stuff that doesn't sell has greater impact than one might think. Write for people.
